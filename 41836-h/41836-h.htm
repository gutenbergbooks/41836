<span class="smaller">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p class="in0"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="dropleftmin">F</span>, in dealing with the life and work of
Carlo Dolci, a writer sets down an apology
by way of preface, it is in recognition
of the fact that the art form of this
painter, for all that it is serious and beautiful,<span class="pagenum in1"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
is one of the first that we outgrow. There
are artists in plenty, and their names are
written large in the roll of fame, whose work
makes no immediate appeal to us. Rembrandt,
Velazquez, Tintoretto, one and all
must be approached with an eye that has
received some measure of training, and then
the beauty of their work brings perennial
enjoyment, though at first it could not be
easily seen. Other men who lived and
thought and wrought on quite a different
plane appeal to the eye right away. Their
work conceals nothing, its beauties are
patent and entirely free from reticence or
subtlety; such painters bear the same relation
to the really great masters of the art as
the writers of the songs sung at Ballad Concerts
bear to the composers of the Pastoral,
Unfinished or Pathetic Symphonies. Yet in
their way it must be admitted that both the<span class="pagenum in1"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
writer of ballads, and the painter of pictures
that please, do a certain service. They help
the uninitiated along the path that leads to
higher things; they are a support that the
timid explorer may rely upon until he has
learnt to walk alone. There comes a time
when the painter of pretty pictures and the
writer of pretty songs cease to please us;
we have mastered what we are pleased to
regard as the tricks of both, and feel a little
contempt for them. Then, perhaps, some of
us are even anxious to forget our former
attitude towards the men who charmed our
youthful fancy. We think we have become
as gods, knowing good from evil, and in this
mood we ignore the fine points of work we
criticise. Carlo Dolci was in many ways
a man who never grew up, but he had a
keen and almost childish sense of beauty
and of righteousness, and he sought to<span class="pagenum in1"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
express it on canvas, leaving the deeper
truths of art, and the more important aspects
of life, to be treated by those who cared to
deal with them. Beauty obvious, palpable;
sentimental virtue as broad and unblushing
as that of Edmund Spenser's heroines, were
the themes that the artist chose to dwell
upon, and it would be in the last degree
unwise to forget that such a message as his
will make a strong appeal to the rising
generation as long as the world endures,
and that by the time those who have been
pleased are pleased no longer, there will be
others waiting to take their place. Moreover
Carlo Dolci laboured with a certain
measure of sincerity until the message he
had chosen to deliver to his generation
became as true to him as the visions that
helped Fra Angelico while he laboured in
the cells of St. Mark's Convent in Florence.<span class="pagenum in1"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
To-day in Florence and in Rome the younger
generation seek the pictures of Carlo Dolci
and find in them a realisation of certain
ideals. We may be a little shocked or even
contemptuous, but to recognise the claims
of those who are coming on as well as the
claims of those who are passing, is to keep
a sane outlook on life. For the world was
not made for the middle-aged and the experienced,
any more than it was created for
the immature enthusiasts. There is a place
on this planet for us all.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption p4" id="PLATE_II">PLATE II.&mdash;POETRY<br />

<p>This canvas was painted for the head of the Corsini Family in
Rome, when Dolci was a young man. It is one of a series that
included Hope, Patience, and Painting. It is now in the Uffizi
Gallery, Florence.</p></div>
<a href="images/i_014l.jpg">
<img src="images/i_014.jpg" width="436" height="500" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Carlo Dolci painted, or over-painted, the
romance of life. It was his misfortune that
he always saw it in the same way. He was
like a musician who, having all the keys of the
piano at his disposal, regards anything more
than the simplest modulation from tonic to
dominant and back again as an extravagance
to which he must not surrender. Nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the horizon of art has widened very considerably;
even in literature the obvious has
passed out of fashion, but in the rather degenerate
days when Carlo Dolci lived physical
beauty was in a sense the keynote of all art
work. No heroine could reach the last chapter
of a romance in safety unless she chanced
to be equipped with a measure of beauty that
defied the assaults of time. Beauty other
than physical was entirely overlooked, or
was associated deliberately with good looks.
Handsome sinners were as far removed from
the public ken as ugly saints. In many
senses the world was younger than it is to-day;
indeed, it has aged more in the past
two hundred years than in five hundred that
went before. Consequently the living painter
of prettiness stands now at a certain disadvantage.
Perhaps he is more handicapped
in the struggle for recognition now than he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
will be a hundred years hence, because
we have but recently taken possession of
our heritage of culture and judgment and
are a little anxious to forget that we have
been young. It may be granted that while
a large collection of the works of a painter
who laboured for all time pleases our every
mood, it would be hard to live in a room in
which Dolci's pictures dominated the walls.
Swinburne has expressed the position very
simply in the first volume of his famous
"Poems and Ballads": "A month or twain
to live on honeycomb is pleasant; but one
tires of scented time."</p>

<p>We suffer from the painter's excess of
sweetness, from a sentiment that comes
dangerously near to sentimentality, from a
quality that is almost as cloying as saccharine;
but taken in the proper proportions,
relegated to their proper place, the pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of Carlo Dolci are bound to please, and we
feel perhaps a little envious of the man who
throughout his life could see nothing that
was not gracious and pleasing, and moral
and sweet. As we have said, he has his
counterpart in literature and in music, and
had he not been forced by circumstances
he could not control into the immediate
neighbourhood of men who had so much
more to say than he, Dolci would have received
more attention from his contemporaries
and from succeeding generations. But,
perhaps unfortunately for himself, Dolci is to
be found only in the best artistic company of
the world. His work hangs in Florence and
in Rome cheek by jowl with that of the
world's great masters; before the flame of
their genius his light pales and becomes insignificant.
Yet he is by no means to be
despised, for he saw through his own little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
window a view of the pageantry of life that
must have made him happy, and was destined
to stimulate generations that have passed
and generations still unborn. His pictures do
not lack sincerity, and do not fail to express
the best that was in him. He saw Holy
Families and saints and living sitters with
an eye that insisted upon beauty and righteousness.
He painted with exquisite finish,
with delicate colouring, and with a measure of
enthusiasm that the years have not dimmed.
In short, though many men have done better,
he did his best, and the pictures that are reproduced
in these pages indicate very fairly
the measure of his achievement, even while
they do nothing to conceal his limitations.
Moreover, while greater artists have had their
biographers by the score, it is hard to find
in the literature of Great Britain, France, or
Italy any work dealing even in the simplest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
fashion with this painter's life, though it does
not deserve to be neglected. Dolci would
seem to have been ignored altogether, and this
attitude of contempt is quite unfair, because
no man who has pleased so many simple
minds is unworthy of our attention, and it
is more reasonable to praise a man for the
gifts that were his than to ignore him on
account of what he lacked.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ARTIST'S LIFE</span></h2>

<p>As was said on a previous page, few
people seem to have been at pains to deal
with the life and work of our painter, and
while the curators of the Italian museums
can tell you little about him, save the approximate
dates of his life and death, and a few
stories relating to events that would perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
have occurred if they could, the catalogue of
the British Museum has no more than one
reference to his name. Tracing the reference
to its source, we find a little paper-covered
pamphlet, written in the closing years of the
seventeenth century and published in Florence
some quarter of a century ago. In the
British Museum library it is bound with two
or three other booklets relating to totally different
matters. The pamphlet that concerns
us was written by Carlo Dolci's friend and
patron, Signor Baldinucci, and has never been
translated into English. Baldinucci was one
of Dolci's intimates, evidently a good friend
and an ardent admirer, a man who praises
generously, but is rather reticent about the
painter's artistic shortcomings, just as though
reticence would avail to keep them hidden
from the understanding eye. However, it is
no bad thing for us that Signor Baldinucci<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
should have been an enthusiast, because
without enthusiasm the bounteous harvest of
facts to which we can turn would not have
been gathered, and we should have been left
in such a state of doubt with regard to the
incidents of the painter's life as besets us in
dealing with so many of the earlier and more
notable men of his art and country.</p>

artist's pictures in terms of quaint enthusiasm,
and happily, too, it does not despise
biographical details. This is as well, for, while
there is no call for very subtle criticism in
the case of Dolci, it is of great interest for us
to discover what manner of man he was and
how he came to paint so many pretty pictures
all in the same key, why he never sought to
enlarge the boundaries of his art, or to see
"with dilated eye." Our biographer is generous;
he gives us facts in plenty, and writes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
just enough about art to enable us to understand
that his knowledge and his enthusiasm
stood in inverse ratio to one another. That
the author had a following is proved by the
fact that the little pamphlet is now out of
print, and though the writer sought diligently
throughout Florence to procure a copy, he
was quite unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Carlo Dolci was born about the year 1616.
His father was a highly respected tailor of
Florence, Andrea Dolci by name, his mother
a daughter of Pietro Marinari, a painter (says
Baldinucci) of repute. Carlo's parents seem
to have been an exemplary couple, who
earned the esteem of all who knew them and
raised a family of five children to follow the
straight and narrow paths of probity. Carlo
is said to have been born on the 25th of May
1616, a day devoted to the honour of St.
Zenobius and Santa Maria Maddalena de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Pazzi. The elder Dolci died when Carlo
was four years old, and his mother was left
in straitened circumstances, with which she
struggled bravely and not without success.
Carlo seems to have been in every respect a
model boy; in fact, if his biographer is strictly
reliable, he was almost too good for the
wicked world he lived in. It would be a
relief to hear that he had moments when he
was not on his best behaviour, that he robbed
orchards, or played truant, or got into one or
other of the scrapes that are associated with
boyhood; but, alas, he did nothing of the kind.
He was not even content to be good, but
wanted all his schoolfellows to follow his
example, and used to persuade them to tell
their beads and say their prayers even when
they were out walking.</p>

<p>At the early age of nine Carlo Dolci gave
unmistakable signs of possessing an artist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
gifts, and was entrusted by his mother to the
care of Jacopo Vignali and Matteo Rosselli.
He worked very hard under these masters,
and was so good that Mr. Barlow of
"Sandford and Merton" fame would have
been moved to tears of joy had he belonged
to the seventeenth century and flourished
in the neighbourhood of Florence, while
Master Harry Sandford would have hidden a
diminished head and confessed that he had
found a greater saint than himself. At the
age of eleven Carlo Dolci painted his first
heads of Christ, one as a child, and the other
crowned with thorns; he also painted a full-length
figure of St. John. Then he painted
a portrait of his mother, who was so pleased
with the work that she took it to his master's
studio, where, as good luck would have it,
Pietro de Medici was in the habit of passing
some of his idle hours. This patron of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
arts was so pleased with the boy's work that
he ordered a portrait of himself and another
of a friend, the musician Antonio Landini.
He also took the pictures that little Carlo
had just painted and showed them to the
leaders of society in Florence, presenting the
young artist to the duke, who could hardly
believe that the work before him had been
accomplished by one so young. In order to
assure himself, he told the boy to sketch two
heads in his presence, only to be so pleased
with the work that he rewarded him handsomely
for it.</p>

<p>Florence, of course, began to talk of the
boy painter, for a prodigy is neither to be despised
nor overlooked in any wealthy city.
His reputation passed from palace to studio,
gathering commissions on its travels, and in
a very little time young Dolci had all the work
he could do. He painted the portrait of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
head of the Bardi family, and that of his
nephew John de Bardi. He painted a portrait
of Raphael Ximenes. When he was
not painting portraits he turned his attention
to still life, painting some fruit and
flower pictures for his Confessor, Canon Carpanti.
His next work was for Lorenzo de
Medici, an "Adoration," for which he asked
twenty scudi and received forty, and then he
painted the subject again on a rather larger
canvas for one of the Genitori family, who
paid seventy scudi. This picture was sold
at the owner's death and realised just four
times the sum that had been paid for it,
while some pictures of the Evangelists
painted by Dolci for one of his Confessors
realised nearly twenty times as much as he
had received.</p>

<p>It may be suggested without much fear
of contradiction, that the success of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
painter's earliest work was not the best thing
that could have happened to him. If he had
been compelled to develop slowly and in the
face of adverse circumstance, it is more
likely that Carlo Dolci would have given the
world work of more lasting merit, but circumstance
forced him to paint for patrons
at a time when he should have been studying
for himself. The style and method of
his labours were settled for him, his development
was limited and circumscribed; with
his native gifts he might have travelled far
had he not been hampered by these early
successes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption p4" id="PLATE_IV">PLATE IV.&mdash;THE ETERNAL FATHER<br />

<p>This plate, so characteristic of the sentiment of Dolci, is only
part of an altar-piece in fresco, painted for one of the religious
houses in the middle of the artist's career.</p></div>
<a href="images/i_036l.jpg">

</div>

<p>From his youth Carlo Dolci had been
devout, the rules of the brotherhood of St.
Benedict appealed to him very strongly. He
passed much of his scanty leisure within the
walls of the brethren in Florence, and, probably
under the influence of his advisers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
there, made a firm resolve to paint nothing
but religious subjects, or those that illustrated
some one of the cardinal virtues. At
the back of each canvas it was his custom
to write the date upon which he had started
the work and the name of the saint to whom
the day was dedicated. In Holy Week his
brush was devoted entirely to subjects relating
to the Passion.</p>

<p>One of his greatest early successes was
a picture of the Madonna with the Infant
Christ and St. John, painted for Signor
Grazzini. This work added so much to his
commissions that he could no longer stay in
Vignali's studio, finding it more convenient
to work at home, where there was more
accommodation in his mother's house. Here
he painted his beautiful picture of St. Paul
for one of the family of Strozzi, and his
picture of St. Girolamo writing, and the penitence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of Mary Magdalen. He also painted
the picture of Christ blessing the bread, a
head of St. Philip of Neri, and the picture of
St. Francis and St. George. For one of his
Corsican patrons he painted a woman with
weights and scales in her hand as Justice,
and for one of the Corsini he painted the
Hope, Patience, Poetry, and Painting, of
which series the Poetry is reproduced here.</p>

<p>In 1648 Carlo Dolci was elected a member
of the Florentine Academy, and, in accordance
with the custom that prevailed, was required
to present one of his pictures to the Academy
on election. Not unnaturally, perhaps, his
thoughts turned to the man with whose
art he sympathised most, Fra Angelico of
Fiesole&mdash;the man whose exquisite work has
made the Florentine Convent of St. Mark
a place of pilgrimage to this day. Oddly
enough there was no portrait of Fra Angelico<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in the Academy. It was necessary to send
to Rome to procure a drawing from which
the portrait could be painted.</p>

<p>The public demand for Carlo Dolci's work
at this time was very greatly in excess of
the supply, but the painter was hardly a
man who sought or obtained the highest
price for his labours. A very little would
seem to have contented him; cases might be
multiplied in which his work was re-sold at
far higher prices than he received for it. For
example, he painted a picture of Mary Magdalen
washing the feet of Christ, and sold the
work to his doctor for 160 scudi. The Marquis
Niccolini offered the doctor 1200 scudi for
it, but could not tempt him to give it up.</p>

<p>By this time the fame of Carlo Dolci
had spread well beyond the boundaries of
Florence; he was known and taken seriously
in art circles of Italy, and his work had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
special attractions for the religious houses
whose heads saw that its influence was
bound to be beneficial. We find the monks
of the Italian Monastery dedicated to Santa
Lucia of Vienna commissioning him to copy
one of their pictures of the Virgin. He made
several drawings and started work on the
picture, but did not finish it for a long time,
and some eight years later he sold it to
some distinguished visitors to Florence for
160 scudi. Dolci was never idle, and his
brush was always busy on canvas or wood,
always setting out some sacred story or
seeking to glorify some virtue. Among the
important pictures belonging to this period
are one of the Martyrdom of St. Andrew,
which was taken to Venice, and one of the
Flight into Egypt, painted for Andrea Rosselli,
a rather graceful if not original composition,
in which the Virgin is seen riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
with the Infant Christ in her arms. The
same subject was commissioned by Lord
Exeter and sent to England.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption p4" id="PLATE_V">PLATE V.&mdash;ANGEL OF THE ANNUNCIATION<br />

<p>This was painted about 1656 for the house of the Benedictines in
Florence. It is one of the most popular of the artist's work, and
has been widely reproduced.</p></div>
<a href="images/i_043l.jpg">
<img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="380" height="500" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The picture of an angel pointing out to
Christian souls the road to Heaven attracted
great comment and praise when it
was painted; so too did two oval pictures,
one of the Archbishop of Florence, and the
other of St. Philip of Neri. A half-length
figure of St. Catherine was another of the
painter's notable works that may be referred
to his middle life. He had acquired the art
of giving to his canvas the high finish of a
miniature, and his colours were very fresh
and glowing. Indeed, it may be said of Carlo
Dolci's work that it has preserved its freshness
to a very remarkable extent; some of the
pictures painted more than 250 years ago
are still glowing with colour, while the work
of many men who came after Dolci has lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
all its original brightness and has become
muddy. This suggests that Dolci had found
time to study the composition of paint with
great care, and that some of the secrets of
glazing surfaces had been revealed to him.
Belonging to the middle period is the picture
of St. Andrew embracing the Cross and
the picture in octagon shape called Charity,
presenting a beautiful woman nursing a
sleeping babe, and holding a flaming heart
in her right hand. A small picture of Hagar
and Ishmael belongs to these years.</p>

<p>In 1655 Carlo Dolci's teacher, Rosselli,
passed away, and in the following year the
artist completed the painting of a standard
that his master had begun. The subject is
St. Benedict on a cloud in a blue sky, and
Dolci is said to have made studies of it
from a picture that was already in possession
of another brotherhood. Composition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
never his strong point. He painted another
standard for the Benedictines, to their great
delight, and in the following year a St.
Dominic on wood, and the famous Angel of
the Lily.</p>

<p>Carlo Dolci was now a married man, for
in 1654, apparently on the advice of his
friends, he married the Signora Teresa di
Giovanni. The suggestion that Carlo Dolci
married to order is supported to some extent
by the incidents of the marriage day.
Baldinucci tells us that the painter's friends
and family, together with the friends and
family of his wife, were all gathered together,
but Carlo did not keep his appointment, and
messengers were despatched all over the city
to find him. He was not at home, he was
not with the Benedicts, he was not in the
churches he favoured most, and dinner-time
had come round when some happy searcher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
found the painter in a church that the others
had overlooked. Having scolded him for forgetting
his appointment, the bride forgave
her absent-minded partner, and the marriage
took place. It was a very happy one.</p>

<p>Some time after this alliance, and when
he had passed his fortieth year, Carlo Dolci
turned his attention to fresco, and painted
a figure of God the Father, the Holy Ghost,
and four archangels. We learn that one of
his pupils painted in the other angels, and
this little fact is worth noting, because it
shows that Carlo Dolci had reached the
period of his life in which the demands for
his work could not be satisfied without
assistance, and he had been forced to follow
the example of great predecessors. We
know that Titian and Tintoretto and other
masters of the Renaissance period in Italy
never scrupled to avail themselves of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
services of clever pupils, and many a picture
that left the studio with the master's name
upon it did not receive more than the
slightest touch of the master's brush. This
scandal, for so we must describe it, has
been common to nearly every period in the
development of art, and was perhaps justified
to some small extent in days when
artists were not rewarded on a generous
scale. While their commissions came from
patrons who would not brook delay, and
were quite well able to make their anger
effective, it was unwise to be too scrupulous
about the means to an end. For the preparation
of a canvas and the painting in of
draperies for portraits the use of pupils may
escape adverse criticism, but when the pressure
of commission became very serious, too
many great artists have succumbed to the
temptation of leaving the bulk of the work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
to be painted by a pupil, trusting to a few
skilled touches to give the completed canvas
the stamp of their own individuality. We
have no means of saying how far Carlo
Dolci indulged in a custom that was common
to his time. We are quite sure that had
he thought it an immoral one he would
have abandoned it without hesitation.</p>

<p>After turning his attention to fresco work
the painter sent a St. Agatha to Venice, together
with a portrait of St. John the Evangelist,
and a picture entitled Sincerity, a
woman garlanded with lilies. For another
picture sent to Venice, representing Christ
crowned with flowers and sitting at the
entrance of a garden, Dolci received 200
scudi, a rather considerable sum when it
is compared with those that were generally
paid for his pictures. This picture was so
successful that he painted another version<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of it in 1675 for a daughter of the Archduke
Ferdinand and Anna de Medici. For this
he received no less than 300 scudi, and the
Marquis Runecini paid the same price for a
picture of St. John, in which the saint sees in
a vision a lady trampling a dragon under
foot. Among other works belonging to this
period are a St. Girolamo, a St. Luke, and a
St. Benedict, all commissioned by his doctor,
Signor Lorenzo.</p>

<p>For one of the Corsini family Dolci
painted St. Anthony with a skull in his hand,
and for Signor Corbinelli the full-length life-size
canvas of the figure of St. Peter. For
the Scalzi Brotherhood he painted the picture
of the Eternal Father that was placed over
the high altar, and a picture of Herodiade
with the head of St. John the Baptist. A
David with the head of Goliath was painted
for the Marquis Runecini, and a copy was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
made for the English ambassador in Florence.
This picture created a sensation when it was
sent to England, and brought the painter
many commissions for the portraits of Englishmen.
The head of the Corsini house had
given Dolci certain commissions, and they
were so well executed that requests followed
for another St. John, and a picture of King
Casimir of Poland. The St. Cecilia playing
the organ, which was sent to Poland, was
painted shortly afterwards.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption p4" id="PLATE_VI">PLATE VI.&mdash;THE MAGDALEN<br />

<p>This picture, painted for a Roman patron, is at present to be
in the Corsini Palace, Rome. It has, however, not been so well
preserved as some of the best work from the same hand.</p></div>
<a href="images/i_054l.jpg">
<img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="338" height="500" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>About this time Sustermans, a painter
some of whose work may be seen and admired
in Florence to-day, was commissioned
to paint a portrait of Claudia, daughter
of the Grand-duke Ferdinand and Anna de
Medici, on the occasion of her marriage with
the Emperor Leopold. But Sustermans on
account of his great age could not accept
the commission, and it was then offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Carlo Dolci, who, although he had lived so
long, and had achieved so large a measure
of renown, had never travelled beyond the
walls of Florence. However, he did not hesitate,
but started out for Innsbrück in the
spring of the year. He arrived in Holy
Week, when, according to his rule of life,
he would not paint secular subjects, but as
soon as Easter had come to an end he
began the portrait commissioned, and was
then asked by the Duke to paint a second
one of the same subject in a different pose.
At Innsbrück Dolci received another commission
of the sort that throws a strong
light upon the ethics of the art world of his
time. He was asked to repaint or touch
up several devotional pictures by great
masters who had passed away, and he does
not seem to have hesitated. It was sufficient
for him that the pictures were of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
a kind that met his approval; he asked
nothing more, but set to work on the canvases
of other men without a qualm. He
was the guest at Innsbrück of the Abbé
Viviani, and by way of expressing his gratitude
for his host's unvarying attention and
kindness he painted a beautiful head of St.
Philip of Neri and gave it to him. Dolci
remained at Innsbrück from April until the
end of August, and received in addition to a
considerable sum of money a gift of valuable
jewels from his grateful patrons.</p>

<p>It was characteristic of the man that on
his return to his native city and before he
took the picture he had painted to the Palace
of the Medici, he went to the church in
Florence at which he was accustomed to
pray, and returned thanks for the happy termination
of his travels. Then he was instructed
by the Medici family to finish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
portrait, so that it might stand for Santa
Galla Placidia, the Empress whose famous
tomb may be seen in Ravenna to this day,
and, indeed, is one of the show-places of that
quaint old city. Dolci then painted a very
charming picture reproduced in these pages,
the sleeping St. John with St. Zacharias and
St. Elizabeth, and following the painting of
this picture is associated the great misfortune
of a life that had hitherto been
pleasant and peaceful. The religious feelings
that had been with him since the days when
he was a little boy busily instructing his
schoolfellows to turn from profane to sacred
thoughts now degenerated into melancholy,
and Dolci suffered from the true melancholia
which baffles physicians to-day, and was then,
of course, quite beyond the reach of palliative
or cure. He could not speak without
deep sighs; he was convinced that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
lost all his ability as a painter, and that the
world had no more use for him. His wife,
who gave up much of her time and attention
to him, suffered in health from the premature
birth of a child, and then Baldinucci, who
wrote the little biography of the artist that
was printed in Florence in the early 'eighties,
and is the foundation of our knowledge of
the artist's life, took the painter away from
Florence to the country to the house of one
Domenico Valdinotti. This man, an artist,
had one or two pictures in his studio commissioned
for wealthy patrons. He took
up a palette with colours mixed, and gave it
to Dolci, commanding him in sternest tones
to finish a veil on one of the pictures of the
Virgin. The painter obeyed, and succeeded
so well in his task that all the doubt and fear
that had clouded his life for the greater part
of a year vanished in an hour, and he returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
to Florence with a perfectly healthy mind
to finish the Santa Galla Placidia, and one
or two altar-pieces, including one for the
Church of San Francesco.</p>

<p>Dolci then received a commission from
the Empress Claude to paint a canvas for
the Imperial Palace, but as she died in the
following April this work was not completed.
But he painted a fine martyrdom
of St. Lorenzo and a striking picture of
St. Francis of Assisi for the Duke. Then
came more commissions from Venice, and
the painter worked at half-a-dozen well-known
pictures for that city. These pictures
showed, perhaps, even more finish than
those that had gone before, because concentration
seems to have been the keynote of
the painter's life, and while other men in all
ages have used art as a means to an end,
and have been unable to avoid the social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
temptations that have beset them in the day
of their success, Carlo Dolci, like Tintoretto
before him, had no care for anything save
his work. So long as health was good he
desired nothing better than to devote the
whole day to labour, and his closest and
most complete attention to what he had in
hand. Of course, one only compares Dolci
with Tintoretto in point of industry; all the
developments that the great Venetian had
made, all the truths he had discovered, were
either unknown to Dolci or ignored by him.
He was painting for a public that knew very
little about art, and regarded exquisite finish
as the surest sign of artistic accomplishment.
Consequently the painter did not seek to develop
along lines of independent thought; he
had no pressing need to do so while everything
he could reasonably require in the way of patronage
and commission was at his command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
In 1682 Luca Giordano came to Florence
to paint frescoes in the Chapel of the Corsini
Palace. He admired Carlo Dolci's work
very much, but used to rally him about the
time he spent on it. "You do beautiful work,
my Carlo," he said; "but how can you make
it pay when you give hours and hours to
that close finish? When I think of the
150,000 scudi I have earned since I took up
the brush, I begin to fear that you will die
hungry."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption p4" id="PLATE_VII">PLATE VII.&mdash;PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST<br />

<p>This is one of the collection of portraits of artists painted, each
by his own hand. As may be seen from the canvas, Dolci executed
it in 1674 when he was approaching his sixtieth year. The canvas
hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence.</p></div>
<a href="images/i_065l.jpg">
<img src="images/i_065.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was perhaps a little unwise to talk in
this fashion to a man who had been suffering
from some form of brain disease, but it is
certain that the words, though they were
only spoken in jest, made a very deep impression
upon the painter. Dolci had just
finished an Adoration of the Magi, and had
sent it to the Palace of the Duchess Vittoria.
Receiving a summons from the Palace, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
went there and heard the Duchess express
herself to him in terms of high praise. Then
she sent his Adoration back to its wall and
ordered one of Giordano's pictures to be
brought to her. "What do you think of
this," she said to Dolci; "is it not a wonderful
piece of work? Can you believe that it
was really painted in such a short time?" and
she named the dates of its commission and
completion. This unlucky remark brought
back all the painter's forebodings. His
friend and biographer tells us that the
Duchess did not mean to hurt his feelings,
she had admired his work for the qualities
it possessed, and in praising Giordano's she
had commented upon what had struck her
most about it&mdash;that is, the rapidity with which
it had been executed. From that hour the
painter went about silent and miserable, he
was seldom heard to speak, and then to add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to his troubles, his wife, to whom he had
been devoted so passionately, died. His
melancholy returned, and his Confessor, remembering
how successfully he had been
treated in the country beyond Florence,
ordered him to turn to a picture of St.
Ludovic and paint the vestments of one of
the figures on the canvas. Dolci did as he
was told, but this time the effort was in vain.
Doubtless his brain had been weakened by
the first attack of melancholia, and fears
for the future, coupled with the shock of a
beloved wife's death, were altogether too
much for the enfeebled constitution of a man
of seventy. He took to his bed, and died on
the 17th of January 1686, leaving a family
of seven daughters and one son. Dolci was
buried in the family vault in the Church of
the Santissima Nunziata, where he had
worshipped so long, and where one of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
friends had found him on his marriage day
when he should have been with his bride.
He did not leave much money behind him,
but quite a large number of pictures that
doubtless served his family in lieu of legacies
at a time when the painter's work would be
in greater demand than ever, because the
limit of his output had been reached.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE ARTIST'S WORK</span></h2>

<p>When we turn from a résumé of the
chief events of the painter's comparatively
uneventful life to an endeavour to estimate
the place he takes in the history of his
country's art we have, in the first place, to
consider the season in which he was born.
Looking at the art history of Florence we
see that Dolci came very late into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
world. From the close of the fourteenth
century, when Fra Angelico was born,
down to the late years of the sixteenth
century, when the last of the great masters
seemed to pass away, Florence had enjoyed
the services of a long series of distinguished
artists. Lippo Lippi, Botticelli, Ghirlandajo,
da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael,
Lorenzo di Credi, Andrea del Sarto, Bronzino,
Cigoli, all these and many others
whose names can hardly be recalled without
delight flourished in Florence, and
while they lived there the city's reputation
filled all the rest of Italy with envy. But
neither a man nor his influence is everlasting;
the great ones passed and left no successors;
when Carlo Dolci appeared upon
the scene the last trace of their influence
had disappeared. Consequently he brought
his gifts to a city from which inspiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
had departed. The great achievements of
the art world were no more than echoes.
Florence had excelled herself in all directions.
Painting had served her greatest
men as no more than one form of expression.
The greatest of them had sought to give
their message to the world through the
medium of more arts than one, and consequently,
he who was a simpler painter
was of comparatively small account. When
Carlo Dolci was born, the time of great
men having passed, no great forces were
at work in his native city. He did not
have the advantage of travel, he was never
called upon to struggle hard and anxiously
for the necessities of life. In some ways
he was regarded as an infant prodigy and
treated as such, and it would be hard to
say that the premature development of gifts
however great has ever served their possessor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
in the long run. No man's work
can be judged properly save in relation to
his circumstances and his time, and, in order
that we may avoid the danger of underrating
Carlo Dolci's achievement and dismissing
for obvious faults what we should
praise for merit, we are forced to consider
the case carefully lest we treat a
deserving man with injustice. Bearing
time, place, and limitations in mind, it is
possible then to consider the painter without
the prejudice that the most glaring
defects of his art are calculated to arouse.</p>

<p>We have seen in the course of our
necessarily short survey that Carlo Dolci
lived to the established age of man, and
started his work before he was in his teens,
that no long journeys or extended sojourns
in foreign countries withdrew him from the
area of his normal activities; we have seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
that he never left Florence save on one
occasion. And, as he was working throughout
his life, his output would have been
uncomfortably large but for the fact that
he never allowed a canvas to leave his studio
until every stroke that his brain could
suggest, and his hand execute, had been
added to it. His conscientiousness alone
availed to check his output, and so intent
was he upon expressing himself as well as
he could within the obvious limitations of
his gift that he never attempted to grapple
with the problems that beset bigger men.</p>

<p>In composition, for example, Carlo Dolci
was distinctly deficient; there is no more
serious charge against him as an artist than
that he could not compose a large figure
picture. If he had to devote himself to
one, under the terms of some commission
from a wealthy patron, he would not hesitate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
to go to other masters in search of
a composition that would suit his purpose.
It may be put to his credit that he did
these things openly, he does not seem
to have claimed for himself the work that
he borrowed from his contemporaries. In
fact, it is quite probable that he knew his
gifts did not lie in the direction of composition;
he regarded it as something that did
not matter very much, and was quite content
with the praises that his single figure
subjects received. One cannot help thinking
that he would have been very successful
as a painter of miniatures.</p>

<p>Dolci impresses us to-day with the feeling
that he was a man who struggled
valiantly and conscientiously with a very
considerable gift, which he had neither the
time nor the will to develop along the lines
that lead from mediocrity to remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
achievement. Then again we must remember
that the fates were not auspicious, he
was not taken in the early days to the studio
of a first-class master, he did not have
the inspiration of great work. By the time
the seventeenth century had travelled over
a third of its appointed course Florentine
art, as we have seen, was hardly in a very
flourishing condition. The days of great experiments
and earnest striving had passed,
and, although Venice is comparatively close
to Florence, and was full even in Carlo
Dolci's days of some of the world's most
inspiring work, although the Venetians were
delighted by Carlo Dolci's rich vivid colouring,
and commissioned many pictures from
his brush, there is no evidence to show that
he ever visited the great city of the Adriatic,
or that he found the time or the inclination
to learn any of the lessons she has to teach.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<div class="caption p4" id="PLATE_VIII">PLATE VIII.&mdash;THE SLEEP OF ST. JOHN<br />

<p>This is one of the last efforts of Dolci. It was painted after his
return from Innsbrück, just before he was taken ill. It hangs in the
Pitti Palace, Florence.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
We cannot, then, look upon Carlo Dolci's
life or work as being complete. He seems
to afford an example of what talent will do
when it lacks adequate direction, and we
see too the danger into which the art of the
painter falls when his inclinations are too
literary. For it was no part of Carlo Dolci's
aim in life to express harmonies in colour
and line, although such expression may be
taken to be the beginning and end of all
that is greatest in painting. Dolci was
always keen on telling a story, always
intent upon preaching a sermon in paint,
always forgetful that the provinces of art
and literature have a very wide boundary
line. It is rather interesting to compare
the lives of Carlo Dolci and Fra Angelico
of Fiesole, because each was a man who
sought to express moral principles, sentiments,
and belief on canvas, and, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
one succeeded beyond all possibility of
doubt, the other has met with only a modified
success. Beato Angelico was influenced
by the Dominicans as Dolci was by the
Benedictines; each gave his life work to the
service of the Church and the pursuit of
virtues that the Church teaches man to practise.
One laboured in the cloister and the
other outside it, but oddly enough, he who
came first and decorated the walls of St.
Mark's Convent knew the more about life
and more about art, more about perspective
and more about composition, than his successor,
who followed so many years later.
The truth is, perhaps, that when Fra Angelico
came to the convent of the Dominicans
the Renaissance was just blossoming in
Italy. It was a season of great inspiration.
Man and Learning were being discovered,
and although some aspects of the discovery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
were hidden from the good brother of St.
Dominic, all the attendant enthusiasms came
to him. Moreover, Angelico travelled and
mingled freely with scholars and great
artists, so that we can divide his life work
into three stages, of which the second is
better than the first, and the last is best of all.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when Dolci came on
the scene the Renaissance had blossomed
and budded and filled the face of the earth
with fruit, but the fruit was already overripe.
The great stimulus had passed; degeneration
had set in, not only in the world
of art. The mere fact that Carlo Dolci's
gifts found an immediate acceptance shows
that the times were not distinguished, and
we do not find in Baldinucci's life of his
friend one solitary suggestion that any of the
great rulers who employed his brush ever
turned to him with the request that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should enter into competition with those
who had gone before, that he should take a
course of study and learning to strengthen
the weak points of his work, sacrificing a
little of its sweetness to gain some small
measure of strength. At the same time
we must not underrate Carlo Dolci's work
because we have outgrown it, since, as was
suggested on an early page of this little
essay, his charm in certain aspects is perennial,
and although its powers to hold us
must pass when we have turned to higher
things, those who are following us will find
pleasure and inspiration in the painter's
art when they visit for the first time the
galleries of Italy. They will travel by easy
degrees from pictures that please to those
that call in the first place for study, and
then for admiration and the recognition of
masterpieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Carlo Dolci's place in art is not altogether
unlike that of some of his living countrymen
in the world of music. There are Italian
musicians known to all of us who have such
a gift of sweetness that we cannot endure
their melodies for long. A song now and
again, or some sparkling little work for piano
or violin, gives us a passing thrill of pleasure,
and then we turn with complete content to
the clearer atmosphere and more serene
moods of the great masters whose works
endure for all time. So it is with Carlo
Dolci; we go to him now and again, if only
for a little while, conscious that sweetness
as well as strength has its place in the world
of art as in the world of music and letters.
And we know, too, that criticism can say
nothing worse about Carlo Dolci's gifts than
that he was never able to turn them to the
best account, that the rough diamond of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
talent was never in the hands of a competent
lapidary. His life is not one we are
called upon to overlook, for his achievement,
though it has little variety, is marked by
certain definite qualities that call for recognition,
even though these qualities are often
moral rather than artistic.</p>

<p>Dolci was eminently a sentimentalist; he
had no redeeming vices; a little of the devilry
of a Benvenuto Cellini would have been invaluable
to him and to his art. But it is
futile to complain of a man for being as
Nature made him, and if we will turn to
Carlo Dolci's pictures for pretty, agreeable,
and highly finished interpretations of moral
ideas in terms of paint, we shall find no
small amount of momentary satisfaction.</p>

<p>We must not forget that the world at
large had suffered not a little when Carlo
Dolci came upon the scene from the excessive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
daring and superb initiative of the
Renaissance. Its eyes were a little dimmed
by the splendour of the great men who had
gone before, and had travelled to heights
beyond the ken of the average citizen. Carlo
Dolci helped to bring his greatly dazzled
fellow-countrymen back to earth, pleasantly
and in fashion that flattered their vanity.
In the eyes of hundreds of his contemporaries
the devout, God-fearing, conscientious
Florentine must have been regarded as the
greatest artist Italy had ever seen, and if
such a thought pleases some of the unsophisticated
among their descendants, who
should desire to complain? Let us rather
put to Dolci's credit the facts that he did not
pose as a heaven-born genius, that he was
not greedy or grasping, that he did not seek
to found a school. The portrait he painted
of himself suggests that he was not altogether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
deficient in humour; perhaps there
were hours when he laughed with himself at
those who praised him for the gifts he
lacked. If we could but be sure that he
laughed now and again at himself and his
pictures, recognising the limitations that are
so patent to us to-day, the most superior
critic could refuse no longer to have some
regard for Carlo Dolci.</p>
